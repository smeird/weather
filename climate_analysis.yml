  name: Climate Analysis
  capabilities:
    temperature:
      - calculate monthly and annual mean, min, max
      - compute seasonal averages (winter, spring, summer, autumn)
      - identify annual extremes: hottest/coldest days, longest hot/cold spells
      - generate degree days (HDD, CDD)
      - build frequency distributions (e.g. nights below 0°C)
    rainfall:
      - compute monthly and annual totals
      - count rain days (≥0.1 mm), wet days (≥1 mm), heavy rain days (≥10 mm)
      - identify longest dry and wet spells
      - calculate rainfall intensity
      - determine rainfall percentiles (e.g. 95th percentile daily rainfall)
    humidity:
      - calculate monthly and annual averages
      - track daily max and min humidity
      - count days >90% or <30% humidity
      - derive dew point trends
    wind:
      - generate wind roses (direction + speed distribution)
      - calculate monthly and annual average wind speeds
      - identify gust statistics (monthly/yearly maxima)
      - determine prevailing wind direction
      - calculate calm frequency (wind <0.5 m/s)
    derived_indices:
      - compute Heat Index (temperature + humidity)
      - compute Wind Chill (temperature + wind)
      - estimate potential evapotranspiration
      - count storm days (defined by thresholds)
    climatological_summaries:
      - produce monthly climate summaries (means, extremes, totals)
      - compile annual climate report (tables, extremes, charts)
      - calculate anomalies vs baseline (multi-year averages)
      - perform trend analysis (linear regression over years)
    extreme_value_statistics:
      - estimate rainfall return periods (e.g. 50 mm/day events)
      - estimate return levels for maximum wind gusts
      - define percentile-based rare event thresholds
    visualisation_and_reporting:
      - generate standard plots (line, bar, anomaly, cumulative rainfall)
      - create wind roses and histograms
      - output annual “climate report” with tables, charts, commentary
