# Weather

This repository powers a PHP-based weather web site. The codebase is organised with a clear separation between front-end and back-end code.

- `frontend/` contains user-facing pages, shared templates in `frontend/includes/`, and static assets under `frontend/assets/`.
- `backend/` hosts database helpers like `dbconn.php` and API scripts for ingesting and serving weather data.

Run `php -l <file>` to perform syntax checks on modified PHP files.
